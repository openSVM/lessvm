# lessVM Specification

## 1. Purpose
The `lessVM` is a minimal virtual machine designed to execute a custom bytecode-based instruction set on the Solana blockchain. It provides basic stack-based operations, arithmetic, memory management, control flow, and Solana-specific operations like token transfers. The VM is limited in size, gas consumption, and memory usage to ensure lightweight and efficient execution within the Solana runtime.

---

## 2. Components
The `lessVM` consists of the following components:

- **Program Counter (`pc`)**: Tracks the current instruction index in the program.
- **Gas Counter (`gas`)**: Tracks the computational cost of executing instructions.
- **Stack**: A last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack used for intermediate computation. Supports operations like `push`, `pop`, `dup`, and `swap`.
- **Memory**: A byte array used for storing and loading data. Supports `store` and `load` operations.
- **Code**: The bytecode program being executed.
- **Accounts**: A reference to Solana accounts, used for blockchain-specific operations like token transfers.
- **Current Account**: Tracks the currently active account for Solana operations.

---

## 3. Opcodes
The `lessVM` supports the following opcodes:

### **Stack Operations**
- `Nop`: No operation.
- `Push1`, `Push2`, `Push4`, `Push8`: Push constants of varying sizes (1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes) onto the stack.
- `Pop`: Remove the top value from the stack.
- `Dup(n)`: Duplicate the `n`th value from the top of the stack to the top.
- `Swap(n)`: Swap the top value with the `n`th value from the top.

### **Math Operations**
- `Add`: Pop two values, add them, and push the result.
- `Sub`: Pop two values, subtract them, and push the result.
- `Mul`: Pop two values, multiply them, and push the result.
- `Div`: Pop two values, divide them, and push the result.
- `MulDiv`: Pop three values `a`, `b`, `c`, compute `(a * b) / c`, and push the result.
- `Min`, `Max`: Pop two values and push the minimum or maximum.

### **Memory Operations**
- `Load`: Load a value from memory and push it onto the stack.
- `Store`: Pop a value from the stack and store it in memory.
- `LoadN`, `StoreN`: Load/store multiple bytes.
- `Msize`: Push the current memory size onto the stack.

### **Control Flow**
- `Jump`: Jump to a specified program counter.
- `JumpI`: Conditional jump (jumps if the top of the stack is non-zero).
- `Call`: Call a subroutine (not yet implemented).
- `Return`: Return from a subroutine (not yet implemented).

### **Solana Operations**
- `Transfer`: Transfer lamports between Solana accounts.
- `SPLOp`: Execute a Solana Program Library (SPL) operation (not implemented).
- `CPI`: Execute a cross-program invocation (not implemented).
- `Log`: Log a value to the Solana runtime.

### **System Operations**
- `Halt`: Halt execution.

---

## 4. State Management
The `lessVM` manages its state as follows:

- **Program Counter (`pc`)**: Incremented after each operation. Modified by control flow instructions like `Jump` and `JumpI`.
- **Gas**: Incremented for each instruction executed. If gas exceeds the limit (200,000), execution halts with an error.
- **Stack**: Operations like `Push` and `Pop` modify the stack. Stack overflow/underflow results in an error.
- **Memory**: Memory is a fixed-size array (1024 bytes). Out-of-bounds accesses result in errors.
- **Current Account**: Tracks the active account for Solana operations like `Transfer`.

---

## 5. Execution Model
The `lessVM` executes instructions in a loop:
1. Fetch the opcode at the current program counter (`pc`).
2. Decode and execute the opcode.
3. Update the program counter (`pc`) for the next instruction.
4. Perform gas accounting.
5. Repeat until a `Halt` instruction is encountered or an error occurs.

---

## 6. Gas Accounting
Each instruction consumes 1 unit of gas. If the total gas exceeds 200,000, execution halts with an "out of gas" error.

---

## 7. Error Handling
The `lessVM` handles errors as follows:
- **Stack Overflow**: Attempting to push more than 32 values onto the stack.
- **Stack Underflow**: Attempting to pop or access a value from an empty stack.
- **Invalid Opcode**: Encountering an unsupported opcode.
- **Memory Access Violation**: Out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Invalid Jump Target**: Jumping to an invalid program counter.
- **Out of Gas**: Exceeding the gas limit.
- **Solana Operation Error**: Errors during Solana-specific operations (e.g., invalid account index).

---

## 8. Accounts and Solana Integration
The `lessVM` interacts with Solana accounts:
- The `accounts` array provides access to Solana accounts.
- The `Transfer` opcode transfers lamports between accounts, modifying their `lamports` balance.
- Each account is referenced by its index in the `accounts` array.

---

## 9. Security Considerations
- **Gas Limit**: Prevents infinite loops and excessive resource usage.
- **Stack and Memory Bounds**: Prevents out-of-bounds access and ensures memory safety.
- **Account Validation**: Ensures valid account indices and proper ownership checks before modifying accounts.
- **Error Propagation**: Errors are propagated as `ProgramError` to the Solana runtime.

---

## Example Program
A simple program to add two numbers and log the result:

```rust
let program = vec![
    OpCode::Push1 as u8, 5,   // Push 5 onto the stack
    OpCode::Push1 as u8, 3,   // Push 3 onto the stack
    OpCode::Add as u8,        // Add the top two values
    OpCode::Log as u8,        // Log the result
    OpCode::Halt as u8,       // Halt execution
];
```

---

## Conclusion
The `lessVM` is a lightweight, stack-based virtual machine tailored for Solana. Its simplicity and constraints ensure efficient execution while maintaining flexibility for common operations like arithmetic, memory management, and token transfers. This spec provides a foundation for understanding and extending the `lessVM`.
