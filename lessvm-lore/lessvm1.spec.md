I'll create a Markdown file named `lessvm_spec.md` with the specification.

# lessVM Specification v1.0

## Overview
lessVM is a stack-based virtual machine designed to run on Solana. It features a simple instruction set with stack manipulation, arithmetic operations, memory access, control flow, Solana-specific operations, and most imporatny ease of deployment, due design specifics it supports "hot-reload" techinuqe which makes its incredibly easy to itareate over onchain pgorgam without spending more than you usually psend on avh solana transactions (current dpleoyment cost u 5 sol).

## VM Architecture

### Resources
- Stack: 32 entries deep, 64-bit values
- Memory: 1024 bytes linear memory space
- Gas: Limited to 200,000 units per execution
- Program Counter (PC): Points to current instruction
- Accounts: Access to Solana account information

### Value Types
- Primary value type is 64-bit unsigned integer (u64)
- Values are stored in little-endian format

## Instruction Set

### Stack Operations (0x0*)
- `0x00 NOP`: No operation
- `0x01 PUSH1`: Push 1 byte as u64
- `0x02 PUSH2`: Push 2 bytes as u64
- `0x03 PUSH4`: Push 4 bytes as u64
- `0x04 PUSH8`: Push 8 bytes as u64
- `0x05 POP`: Remove top stack item
- `0x06 DUP n`: Duplicate nth stack item
- `0x07 SWAP n`: Swap top with nth stack item

### Math Operations (0x1*)
- `0x10 ADD`: a + b (wrapping)
- `0x11 SUB`: a - b (wrapping)
- `0x12 MUL`: a * b (wrapping)
- `0x13 DIV`: a / b (wrapping)
- `0x14 MULDIV`: (a * b) / c (wrapping)
- `0x15 MIN`: min(a, b)
- `0x16 MAX`: max(a, b)

### Memory Operations (0x2*)
- `0x20 LOAD`: Load 8 bytes from memory
- `0x21 STORE`: Store 8 bytes to memory
- `0x22 LOADN`: Load n bytes from memory
- `0x23 STOREN`: Store n bytes to memory
- `0x24 MSIZE`: Push current memory size

### Control Flow (0x3*)
- `0x30 JUMP`: Unconditional jump
- `0x31 JUMPI`: Conditional jump
- `0x32 CALL`: Call subroutine
- `0x33 RETURN`: Return from subroutine

### Solana Operations (0x4*)
- `0x40 TRANSFER`: Transfer SOL between accounts
- `0x41 SPLOP`: SPL token operations
- `0x42 CPI`: Cross-program invocation
- `0x43 LOG`: Log value to program output

### System Operations (0xF*)
- `0xFF HALT`: Stop execution

## Error Codes
1. Stack overflow
2. Stack underflow
3. Invalid DUP depth
4. Invalid SWAP depth
5. Memory store out of bounds
6. Memory load out of bounds
7. Invalid instruction fetch
8. Invalid byte fetch
9. Invalid u64 fetch
10. Invalid JUMP target
11. Invalid JUMPI target
12. Invalid opcode
13. Out of gas

## Gas Costs
- Base cost per instruction: 1 gas unit
- Maximum gas limit: 200,000 units

## Security Constraints
1. No self-modifying code
2. Bounded execution time
3. Bounded memory usage
4. Protected account access
5. No arbitrary CPI without proper checks

## Program Format
Programs are binary sequences of opcodes and their immediate arguments. Each instruction is at least 1 byte long.

## Example Program
```
// Add two numbers (5 + 3)
PUSH1 5    // 0x01 0x05
PUSH1 3    // 0x01 0x03
ADD        // 0x10
HALT       // 0xFF
```

This specification provides a foundation for implementing and using the lessVM. It can be extended with additional features and optimizations while maintaining backward compatibility.
