# Revised Plan

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Refactoring**

1.  **Explore the existing `ideless` project:** (Completed)
    *   List files in `ideless` directory.
    *   Read `ideless/Cargo.toml` to understand dependencies.
    *   List files in `ideless/src` to understand core components.
    *   Read `ideless/src/main.rs` to understand application structure.
2.  **Remove CHIP-8 and gaming-related code:**
    *   Remove the `ch8` module and all its dependencies.
    *   Remove any code related to CHIP-8 emulation from `src/main.rs` and other modules.
    *   Remove the roms directory.
3.  **Update `Cargo.toml`:**
    *   Remove dependencies related to CHIP-8 emulation (e.g., `rodio`).
    *   Add `lessvm-solana` as a dependency.
    *   Add `ratatui` as a dependency.
    *   Add `llm` or similar AI agent crate as a dependency.
4.  **Implement the core `lessvm` support:**
    *   Integrate the `lessvm` runtime into the project. This will involve modifying the existing `VM` struct or creating a new one to support `lessvm` instructions.
    *   Implement a `lessvm` loader to load `lessvm` bytecode into the VM.
5.  **Implement the `ratatui` TUI:**
    *   Integrate the `ratatui` crate to create the user interface. This will involve modifying the existing rendering logic to display the `lessvm` state.
6.  **Implement the AI agent:**
    *   Integrate a suitable AI agent crate (e.g., `llm`) to provide assistance during development. This will involve creating a new module to handle communication with the AI agent.

**Phase 2: Feature Implementation**

1.  **Implement TDD tests:** Write unit and integration tests for all core functionalities.
2.  **Implement examples:** Create example projects for on-chain gaming, DeFi, liquid staking, drift-bot, Raydium-bot, PF-sniper, and on-chain game Tron.
3.  **Implement CU estimator:** Develop a module to precisely estimate the compute units of `lessvm` code, both total and by line.
4.  **Implement decompilation support:** Integrate with `opensvm.com` to support decompiling programs from program addresses.
5.  **Implement debug/simulation support:** Integrate with `opensvm.com` to support debugging and simulating transactions from transaction IDs.
6.  **Implement livecoding sessions:** Generate temporary URLs for livecoding sessions.
7.  **Implement built-in registry:** Create a registry of `lessvm` programs.
8.  **Implement e2e tests:** Write end-to-end tests to ensure all features work correctly together.

**Phase 3: Testing and Refinement**

1.  **Achieve 100% test coverage:** Ensure that all code is covered by unit and integration tests.
2.  **Run all tests:** Run all unit, integration, and e2e tests to ensure that the project is stable and reliable.
3.  **Refactor and optimize:** Refactor the code to improve performance, readability, and maintainability.

**Phase 4: Finalization**

1.  **Run and check:** Manually go through each feature in the UI and make sure all pages are loading without lags and correctly according to data from mainnet.
2.  **Attempt completion:** Use the `attempt_completion` tool to present the result to the user.
