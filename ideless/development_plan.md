# LessVM IDELess Development Plan

This document outlines the development strategy, timeline, and milestones for building the LessVM IDELess development environment.

## Project Overview

IDELess is a comprehensive integrated development environment specifically designed for LessVM on Solana. It combines a code editor, debugger, simulator, deployment tools, and AI assistant in a cohesive application that streamlines the development workflow for LessVM programs.

## Development Philosophy

The development of IDELess will follow these core principles:

1. **User-Centered Design**: All features and interfaces will be designed with the developer experience as the primary consideration.

2. **Iterative Development**: The project will be built incrementally, with regular releases that add functionality and incorporate user feedback.

3. **Component-Based Architecture**: The system will be built as a collection of loosely coupled components that can be developed and tested independently.

4. **Performance Focus**: Performance considerations will be integrated throughout the development process, not added as an afterthought.

5. **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing, code reviews, and quality assurance will be integral to the development process.
