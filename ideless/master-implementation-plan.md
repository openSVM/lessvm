# Master Implementation Plan: LessVM Integration for Ideless

## 1. Project Overview

This master implementation plan outlines the comprehensive strategy for refactoring the ideless project (a fork of c8) to support LessVM with an integrated AI agent for enhanced development. The project will maintain the ratatui TUI interface while completely replacing the underlying CHIP-8 functionality with a robust LessVM development environment. This transformation will create a powerful, terminal-based IDE for LessVM development with features like precise Compute Unit estimation, decompiling, debugging, simulation, and project templating.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals

- Replace CHIP-8 emulation with complete LessVM support
- Maintain and enhance the ratatui TUI interface
- Integrate an AI agent to facilitate development
- Implement comprehensive TDD testing methodology
- Create a precise Compute Units (CU) estimator
- Support program decompilation, debugging, and simulation
- Provide templates for various LessVM application types

### 2.2 Key Requirements

- All code must be implemented in Rust
- The UI must remain as a ratatui TUI
- The system must use OpenSVM RPC servers by default
- 100% test coverage is required
- Include templates for on-chain gaming, DeFi, liquid staking, trading bots, etc.
- Provide precise CU estimation (total and line-by-line)
- Support decompiling programs from opensvm.com/program/{address}
- Support debugging/simulation using opensvm.com/tx/{txid}
- Enable livecoding sessions with temporary URLs
- Include a built-in registry of LessVM programs

## 3. Component Overview

The project is divided into six major components, each with its own detailed implementation plan:

1. **TDD Tests** - Comprehensive test framework ensuring 100% coverage
2. **LessVM Core** - Fundamental LessVM support replacing CHIP-8 functionality
3. **Ratatui TUI** - Terminal user interface maintaining ratatui while supporting new features
4. **AI Agent** - Integrated assistance for LessVM development
5. **Project Templates** - Pre-built templates for various LessVM application types
6. **CU Estimator** - Precise computation cost analysis for LessVM programs

Each component has a detailed implementation plan that outlines specific tasks, timelines, resources, and success metrics.
