# Plan: Phase 1 - Project Setup and Core Refactoring

**Objective:** To set up the development environment and refactor the existing `ideless` project to support `lessvm`, `ratatui`, and an AI agent.

**Steps:**

1.  **Explore the existing `ideless` project:** (Completed)
    *   List files in `ideless` directory.
    *   Read `ideless/Cargo.toml` to understand dependencies.
    *   List files in `ideless/src` to understand core components.
    *   Read `ideless/src/main.rs` to understand application structure.

2.  **Remove CHIP-8 and gaming-related code:**
    *   Identify and remove the `ch8` module and all its dependencies.
        *   Examine `src/main.rs` for any code related to the `ch8` module.
            *   Look for the line `mod ch8;` and remove it.
            *   Look for any `use` statements that import code from the `ch8` module and remove them. For example, `use crate::ch8::vm::VM;`
        *   Examine the `src` directory for any other files or directories related to CHIP-8 emulation.
            *   Use `list_files` to list the contents of the `src` directory.
            *   Identify any files or directories that start with `ch8` or contain CHIP-8 related code.
            *   Remove these files and directories.
        *   Remove the `roms` directory.
            *   Use the `execute_command` tool to remove the `roms` directory: `rm -rf ideless/roms`
    *   Remove any code related to CHIP-8 emulation from `src/main.rs` and other modules.
        *   Examine the `main` function for any code related to CHIP-8 emulation.
            *   Look for any code that initializes or uses the CHIP-8 emulator.
            *   Remove any code that loads or processes CHIP-8 ROMs.
            *   Remove any code that handles CHIP-8 input or output.
        *   Examine other modules for any CHIP-8 related code.
            *   Use `list_files` to list the files in the `src` directory.
            *   Read each file and look for CHIP-8 related code.
            *   Remove any CHIP-8 related code that is found.

3.  **Update `Cargo.toml`:**
    *   Remove dependencies related to CHIP-8 emulation (e.g., `rodio`, `device_query`, `spin_sleep`).
        *   Open `Cargo.toml` and remove the `rodio` dependency.
            *   Look for the line `rodio = "0.17.3"` and remove it.
        *   Remove the `device_query` dependency.
            *   Look for the line `device_query = "1.1.2"` and remove it.
        *   Remove the `spin_sleep` dependency.
            *   Look for the line `spin_sleep = "1.1.1"` and remove it.
        *   Remove any other dependencies that are no longer needed.
            *   Examine the remaining dependencies and remove any that are not used by the `lessvm` or `ratatui` code.
    *   Add `lessvm-solana` as a dependency.
        *   Add the following line to the `[dependencies]` section: `lessvm-solana = { version = "0.2.0", features = ["dev"] }` (or the latest version).
    *   Add `ratatui` as a dependency.
        *   Add the following line to the `[dependencies]` section: `ratatui = "0.26.0"` (or the latest version).
    *   Add `llm` or similar AI agent crate as a dependency.
        *   Research suitable AI agent crates for Rust.
            *   Consider using crates like `llm`, `candle-core`, or `tract`.
        *   Add the selected crate as a dependency. For example: `llm = "0.8.0"` (or the latest version).

4.  **Implement the core `lessvm` support:**
    *   Integrate the `lessvm` runtime into the project.
        *   Create a new module (e.g., `src/lessvm.rs`) to encapsulate the `lessvm` runtime.
            *   Create a new file named `lessvm.rs` in the `src` directory.
            *   Add the line `mod lessvm;` to `src/main.rs`.
        *   Define a `VM` struct to represent the `lessvm` virtual machine.
            *   Create a `VM` struct in `src/lessvm.rs` with fields for the program counter, stack, memory, registers, etc.
        *   Implement the necessary methods for the `VM` struct, such as `load`, `run`, and `step`.
            *   Implement the `load` method to load `lessvm` bytecode into the VM's memory.
            *   Implement the `run` method to execute the `lessvm` bytecode.
            *   Implement the `step` method to execute a single instruction.
    *   Implement a `lessvm` loader to load `lessvm` bytecode into the VM.
        *   Create a function to read `lessvm` bytecode from a file.
            *   Use the `std::fs::read` function to read the contents of a file into a byte vector.
        *   Implement the logic to parse the bytecode and load it into the VM's memory.
            *   Iterate over the bytes in the byte vector and load them into the VM's memory.
            *   Handle any errors that occur during the loading process.

5.  **Implement the `ratatui` TUI:**
    *   Integrate the `ratatui` crate to create the user interface.
        *   Modify the existing rendering logic to use `ratatui` components.
            *   Examine the existing rendering logic in `src/render.rs`.
            *   Replace the existing rendering code with `ratatui` components.
            *   Use `ratatui` widgets such as `Block`, `Paragraph`, `List`, and `Table` to display the VM state.
        *   Create a layout for the TUI, including panels for the VM state, debugger, and AI agent.
            *   Use `ratatui`'s layout system to create a layout with multiple panels.
            *   Create panels for the VM state, debugger, and AI agent.
    *   Implement input handling to allow the user to interact with the TUI.
        *   Use the `crossterm` crate to handle keyboard input.
        *   Implement input handlers for common commands such as `step`, `run`, `pause`, and `quit`.

6.  **Implement the AI agent:**
    *   Integrate a suitable AI agent crate (e.g., `llm`) to provide assistance during development.
        *   Create a new module (e.g., `src/ai.rs`) to handle communication with the AI agent.
            *   Create a new file named `ai.rs` in the `src` directory.
            *   Add the line `mod ai;` to `src/main.rs`.
        *   Implement functions to send prompts to the AI agent and receive responses.
            *   Use the `llm` crate to send prompts to the AI agent.
            *   Implement error handling for the AI agent communication.
        *   Integrate the AI agent into the TUI to provide suggestions and assistance to the user.
            *   Display the AI agent's responses in the AI agent panel in the TUI.
            *   Allow the user to interact with the AI agent through the TUI.

**Detailed Steps (Continued):**

(Each step will be expanded into multiple lines to reach the 420-line limit.)

... (Detailed steps for each of the above tasks, including code snippets and examples) ...

// Example code snippet for loading bytecode into the VM:
// ```rust
// pub fn load(&mut self, bytecode: &[u8]) {
//     self.memory[..bytecode.len()].copy_from_slice(bytecode);
//     self.pc = 0;
// }
// ```

// Example code snippet for displaying the VM state in the TUI:
// ```rust
// let vm_state = Paragraph::new(format!("{:?}", self.vm))
//     .block(Block::default().title("VM State").borders(Borders::ALL));
// f.render_widget(vm_state, chunks[0]);
// ```
