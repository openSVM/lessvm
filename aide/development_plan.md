# LessVM IDELess AI Assistant Development Plan

This document outlines the development strategy, timeline, and milestones for building the AI Assistant component (AIDE) of the LessVM IDELess development environment.

## Project Overview

AIDE is the AI assistant component of IDELess, providing context-aware assistance, code suggestions, error resolution, and learning resources to developers working with LessVM on Solana. It integrates advanced AI capabilities directly into the development workflow to enhance productivity and code quality.

## Development Philosophy

The development of AIDE will follow these core principles:

1. **User-Centered Design**: All features and interfaces will be designed with the developer experience as the primary consideration.

2. **Iterative Development**: The project will be built incrementally, with regular releases that add functionality and incorporate user feedback.

3. **Component-Based Architecture**: The system will be built as a collection of loosely coupled components that can be developed and tested independently.

4. **Performance Focus**: Performance considerations will be integrated throughout the development process, not added as an afterthought.

5. **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing, code reviews, and quality assurance will be integral to the development process.
